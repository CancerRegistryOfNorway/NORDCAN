# NORDCAN
NORDCAN is a database of cancer statistics for the Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the Faroe Islands, and Greenland. 

To ensure that data is computed safely the same way within each registry, a set of R-packages is developed. This allows for only quality assured aggregated data to be shared outside of the registries.
