# NORDCAN
NORDCAN is a database of cancer statistics for the Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, the Faroe Islands, and Greenland. One of the main aims of this project is to develop R-programs that will enable data to be computed safely the same way within each registry, so that only quality assured aggregated data are shared outside of the registries.
