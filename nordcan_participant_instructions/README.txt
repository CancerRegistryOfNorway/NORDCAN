## Instructions

### Official release 2023-05-03

Each participant should define their own datasets according to the manual
(nordcan_call_for_data_manual.html) and then compile the statistics by running
through the script nordcan.R.

It is absolutely paramount that participants look at the results they get
and the results of the comparison to NORDCAN 9.2 statistics.

### Recommended R-version
We recommend using R 4.0.3 for running nordcan.R version 9.3_1.3. 
There might be issues if trying to rund on R 4.2.0 or higher version. 

### Contact info

We are available on the NORDCAN slack if you encounter a problem with our
R packages or if you have questions about the call for data or other
NORDCAN matters. We ask the participants _not_ to send e-mail concerning these
matters because we want all the information in one place.
